to run the standalone TOV solver follow these steps:
1. compile it using ./compilation_script
2. run the executable TOV as follows
./TOV [1] [2] [3] [4]
    [1] = name of EOS file with the following format:
        first column is number density in fm^-3          second column is energy density in MeV/fm^3        third colum is pressure in MeV/fm^3
    [2] = starting number density
    [3] = ending number density
    [4] = steps in number density
so, for example
                                                 ./TOV EOS_APR.dat 0.1 1.3 100
gives a nice TOV M-R sequence for the APR EOS. The output is as follows
        first column is number density in fm^-3          second column is gravitational mass in M_sol       third column is radius in km

to run the DM-modified TOV solver follow these steps:
1. compile it using ./compilation_script
2. run the executable TOV as follows
./TOV [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
    [1] = name of EOS file with the following format:
        first column is number density in fm^-3          second column is energy density in MeV/fm^3        third colum is pressure in MeV/fm^3
    [2] = starting number density
    [3] = ending number density
    [4] = steps in number density
    [5] = DM central density in fm^-3
    [6] = DM mass in GeV
    [7] = g_chi/m_pi --- DM self-interaction in GeV^-1
so, for example
                                                 ./DMTOV EOS_APR.dat 0.55 0.55 1 0.5 0.1 1e7
shows the effect on an APR TOV star with mass approximately equal to 1.4 M_sol
