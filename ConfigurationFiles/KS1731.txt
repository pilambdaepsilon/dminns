# The star KS 1731-260 is in the direction of Baade's Window, making it observable.
# It is approximately near the center of the Milky Way, at about 8 kpc from us and 1
# kpc from the GC. We could not find a source with the star's approximate age, so we
# are taking a conservative guess of 10^9 years old.
